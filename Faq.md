# Frequently Asked Questions

## 1. Listeners/Event Handling
You can customize this bot with listeners, having custom replies and able to perform some really cool actions when something happens (e.g. When someone closes a thread or when someone opens a thread and many more). But be aware of anything you're doing inside the listener as it might crash or cause the bot to malfunction.
 - **Things To Be Aware Of:**
      - Deleting Messages
      - Sending Messages
      - Reacting To Messages
      - Editing Channels

## 2. What's the `customReply` option in the config file for ?
As you know, there are many things you can customize when you set this bot up, but at the same time some users might not want to customize their bot and prefer to use default replies, and this is what `customReply` for, if you would like to customize replies for some serious situation that requires some actions (e.g. Reacting ✅ to the message when a staff replies to a thread) to prevent confusion. This option was disabled by default. 

## 3. Support for other databases
This modmailbot only supports (currently) MongoDB, as its hard for us to add support for more databases. With that said, if you can, please do contribute codes that adds support for other databases. 🤗🤗
